# Session Search
## About
Goals of this project:
The goal of this project was to create a UI that allows a user to select options from a drop down and see a query of their selections in a table.
- Clicking the “X” on an individual row should remove that single row from your criteria set.
- Clicking the “X” on the first row, when no other rows exist, should simply reset; in other words, there should always be one row on the screen.
- Clicking the blue “And” button should add another row.
- Clicking “Reset” should clear your search criteria.
- When the user submits a valid search, the resulting SQL generated should be displayed in the UI within the “Your Generated SQL Statement goes here:” section
